GeoPressureR is a R package which help researchers determine the position of a bird based on the data retrieved from multi-sensor geolocators. 

The main novelty of this package is to match atmospheric pressure measurements to weather reanalysis database (ERA-5) and produce a probability maps of position.

In addition, we use a graphical model to combine pressure, light, acceleration and windspeed data into a trajectory model of the bird. 

## Learn how to use GeoPressureR

The [GeoPressureManual](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureManual/) is a great place to start learning about how you can determine the trajectory of your bird. 

Using the example of a Great Reed Warbler (18LX), this user guide takes you through each step of the analysis in detail.

## Start your own analysis

Once you are familiar with the method and want to start your own study, we suggest you use  [GeoPressureTemplate](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureTemplate), a [github template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) which provides a standard code structure for your analysis. 

Using this standardized code structure and output will allow for code sharing and troubleshooting, data archiving, work reproducibility, and easy check by reviewers.
