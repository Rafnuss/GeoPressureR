\title{Extract a \code{path} from a \code{tag}}
\usage{
tag2path(tag, likelihood = NULL, interp = FALSE, use_known = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tag}{a GeoPressureR \code{tag} object}

\item{likelihood}{Field of the \code{tag} list containing the likelihood map (character). Possible
value are \code{map_pressure}, \code{map_light}, \code{map_pressure_mse}, \code{map_pressure_mse},
\code{map_pressure_mse}, \code{mask_water}. Default \code{NA} is to take the product of \code{map_pressure} and
\code{map_light}, or if not available, taking the first of the possible values.}

\item{use_known}{If true, enforce the known position in the path created. The known positions are
approximated to the map resolution in order to corresponds to integer index.}
}
\value{
A path data.frame
\itemize{
\item \code{stap_id} stationary period
\item \code{ind} indices of the coordinate in the 2D grid. Useful to retrieve map or graph information.
\item \code{lat} Latitude,
\item \code{lon} longitude
}
}
\description{
Find the position of the highest value in a map, typically most probable value in a likelihood
map.

Note that this path is the most likely, considering only the observation model and ignoring the
movement model. Prefer to use \code{graph_most_likely()} for the most realistic path accounting for
flight duration.

\code{interp} can be used to interpolate unrealistic position from short stationary periods based on
the position of the longer ones. In order to preserve a reference to the grid, the interpolation
is only performed at the center of the grid cell (defined by the \code{likelihood} map). Note also
that it is not possible to interpolate the first and last stationary period.

owd <- setwd(system.file("extdata", package = "GeoPressureR"))
tag <- tag_create("18LX", quiet = TRUE) |>
  tag_label(quiet = TRUE) |>

# Extract a path from pressure map
path <- tag2path(tag)
plot_path(path)

# Short stationary periods (e.g. 1 day) can be unreliably
# estimated, so interpolating them is often better
path <- tag2path(tag, interp = 1)
plot_path(path)
