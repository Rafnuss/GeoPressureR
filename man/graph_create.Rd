\usage{
graph_create(
  tag,
  thr_likelihood = 0.99,
  thr_gs = 150,
  likelihood = NULL,
  geosphere_dist = geosphere::distHaversine,
  geosphere_bearing = geosphere::bearing,
  workers = 1,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tag}{a GeoPressureR \code{tag} object.}

\item{thr_likelihood}{threshold of percentile (see details).}

\item{thr_gs}{threshold of groundspeed (km/h)  (see details).}

\item{likelihood}{Field of the \code{tag} list containing the likelihood map (character). Possible
value are \code{map_pressure}, \code{map_light}, \code{map_pressure_mse}, \code{map_pressure_mse},
\code{map_pressure_mse}, \code{mask_water}. Default \code{NA} is to take the product of \code{map_pressure} and
\code{map_light}, or if not available, taking the first of the possible values.}

\item{geosphere_dist}{function to compute the distance. Usually, either
\code{geosphere::distHaversine} (fast) or \code{geosphere::distGeo} (precise but slow). See
https://rspatial.org/raster/sphere/2-distance.html for more options and details.}

\item{geosphere_bearing}{function to compute the bearing. Either \code{geosphere::bearing} (default)
or \code{geosphere::bearingRhumb}. See https://rspatial.org/raster/sphere/3-direction.html#bearing
for details.}

\item{workers}{number of workers used in the computation of edges ground speed. More workers
(up to the limit \code{future::availableCores()}) usually makes the computation faster, but because
the the number of edges is large, memory will often limit the computation.}

\item{quiet}{logical to hide messages about the progress.}
}
\value{
Graph as a list
\itemize{
\item \code{s}: source node (index in the 3d grid lat-lon-stap)
\item \code{t}: target node (index in the 3d grid lat-lon-stap)
\item \code{gs}: average ground speed required to make that transition (km/h) as complex number
representing the E-W as real and S-N as imaginary
\item \code{obs}: observation model, corresponding to the normalized likelihood in a 3D matrix of size
\code{sz}
\item \code{sz}: size of the 3d grid lat-lon-stap
\item \code{stap}: data.frame of all stationary periods (same as \code{tag$stap})
\item \code{equipment}: node(s) of the first stap (index in the 3d grid lat-lon-stap)
\item \code{retrieval}: node(s) of the last stap (index in the 3d grid lat-lon-stap)
\item \code{mask_water}: logical matrix of water-land
\item \code{param}: list of parameters including \code{thr_likelihood} and \code{thr_gs} (same as \code{tag$param})
}
}
\description{
This function returns a trellis graph representing the trajectory of a bird based on filtering
and pruning the likelihood maps provided.

In the final graph, we only keep the likely nodes (i.e., position of the bird at each
stationary periods) defined as (1) those whose likelihood value are within the threshold of
percentile \code{thr_likelihood} of the total likelihood map and (2) those which are connected to
at least one edge of the previous and next stationary periods requiring an average ground speed
lower than \code{thr_gs} (in km/h).
