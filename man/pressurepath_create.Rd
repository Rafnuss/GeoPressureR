\arguments{
\item{tag}{a GeoPressureR \code{tag} object.}

\item{path}{a GeoPressureR \code{path} data.frame.}

\item{variable}{ERA5 variable/parameters available to download.
The most commonly used variables:\code{"altitude"}, \code{"surface_pressure"}, \code{"temperature_2m"},
\code{"u_component_of_wind_10m"}, \code{"v_component_of_wind_10m"}, \code{"u_component_of_wind_100m"},
\code{"v_component_of_wind_100m"}, \code{"total_cloud_cover"}, \code{"total_precipitation"}, \code{"land_sea_mask"}.
All variables can be listed with \code{GeoPressureR:::pressurepath_variable}.}

\item{solar_dep}{a numerical value representing the solar depression angle used to compute
sunrise and sunset. If \code{NULL}, does not compute sunrise sunset.}

\item{era5_dataset}{select the dataset to use: \code{"single-levels"} for \href{https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.adbb2d47}{ERA5 hourly data on single levels}, \code{"land"} for \href{https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac}{ERA5-Land hourly data} or \code{"both"} to use land where available and sing-levels
otherwise (i.e. over water). LAND has greater precision but is not available on water. Using a
single one makes the query faster.}

\item{preprocess}{logical to pre-process pressure data with \code{geopressure_map_preprocess()}.}

\item{timeout}{duration before the code is interrupted both for the request on
GeoPressureAPI and on GEE (in seconds, see \code{httr2::req_timeout()}).}

\item{workers}{number of parallel requests on GEE. Integer between 1 and 99.}

\item{quiet}{logical to hide messages about the progress}

\item{debug}{logical to display additional information to debug a request}

\description{
A \code{pressurepath} is a data.frame merging \code{path} and \code{tag$pressure}. It can be thought as the
equivalent of the measurement of variables by sensors equipped on the bird moving along a
specific \code{path}.

Any ERA variables can be retrieve but the functions is most notably used to retrieve ERA5
surface pressure to then be able to compare it to the pressure measured by the tag, and
potentially adjust labelling tag data.

By default, We use both the \href{https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac}{ERA5 LAND} and
\href{https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.adbb2d47}{ERA5 surface level} if position over water. Available
variables can be listed with \code{GeoPressureR:::pressurepath_variable} and details description
can be found on the \href{https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5\%3A+data+documentation#heading-Parameterlistings}{parameter listings in ERA5 doc}.
Note that their exact name might be be different as we query them through Google Earth Engine.

Positions during the flight are estimated by linear interpolation of the position of the stap
before and after. \code{pressurepath_create()} does not return measurement for stationary periods
which are not provided in \code{path} as well as the flight before and after.

also return the altitude of the bird along its trajectory. The altitude
\eqn{z_{tag}} (a.s.l.) is computed from the tag pressure \eqn{P_{tag}}, using the barometric
equation \deqn{ z_{{tag}}(x)=z_{ERA5}(x) + \frac{T_{ERA5}(x)}{L_b}  \left(
\frac{P_{tag}}{P_{ERA5}(x)} \right)^{\frac{RL_b}{g M}-1},}
where \eqn{z_{ERA}}, \eqn{T_{ERA}}, and \eqn{P_{ERA}} respectively correspond to the ground level
elevation, temperature at 2m, and ground level pressure of ERA5, \eqn{L_b}  is the standard
temperature lapse rate, \eqn{R} is the universal gas constant, \eqn{g} is the gravity constant
and  \eqn{M} is the molar mass of air. See more information at
\href{https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureAPI/#description-1}{the GeoPressureAPI documentation}.

To be able to compare the temporal variation of the retrieved pressure of ERA5 \eqn{P_{ERA}} to
the tag pressure \eqn{P_{tag}}, the function also returns the ERA pressure normalized with
the tag mean pressure measurement as \code{surface_pressure_norm}.
\deqn{ P_{ERA5,0}(\boldsymbol{x})[t] = \left( P_{ERA5}(\boldsymbol{x})[t]-P_{tag}[t]\right) -
\left( \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{ERA5}(\boldsymbol{x})[i]-P_{tag}[i] \right).}

\code{pressurepath_create()} also computes the local sunrise and sunset times for each timestep
according to the position of the path using \code{path2twilight()}. Sunrise and sunset are defined
by the solar depression angle \code{solar_dep}.
