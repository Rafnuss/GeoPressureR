\title{Compute windspeed and airspeed on a \code{graph}}
\usage{
graph_add_wind(graph, thr_as = Inf, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a GeoPressureR graph object.}

\item{thr_as}{threshold of airspeed (km/h).}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=edge_add_wind]{edge_add_wind}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{pressure}}{pressure measurement of the associated \code{tag} data used to estimate the pressure
level (i.e., altitude) of the bird during the flights. This data.frame needs to contain \code{date} as
POSIXt and \code{value} in hPa.}
    \item{\code{rounding_interval}}{temporal resolution on which to query the variable (min). Default is to
match ERA5 native resolution (1hr).}
    \item{\code{interp_spatial_linear}}{logical to interpolate the variable linearly over space, if \code{FALSE}
takes the nearest neighbour. ERA5 native resolution is 0.25°}
    \item{\code{quiet}}{logical to hide messages about the progress}
    \item{\code{file}}{absolute or relative path of the ERA5 wind data file to be downloaded. Function
taking as single argument the stationary period identifier.}
  }}
}
\value{
a \code{graph} object with windspeed and airspeed as \code{ws} and \code{as} respectively.
}
\description{
Reads the NetCDF files downloaded and interpolate the average windspeed experienced by the
bird on each possible edge, as well as the corresponding airspeed.

In addition, the graph can be further pruned based on a threshold of airspeed \code{thr_as}.
