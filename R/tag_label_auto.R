#' Automatic labelling acceleration data of a `tag`
#'
#' @description
#' This function uses acceleration data to classify migratory flights. The function uses a
#' `k=2` mean clustering ([`kmeans()`]) to identify high activity periods. Periods of high activity
#'  lasting more than `min_duration` are then considered to be migratory flight.
#'
#' Additionally, we perform a post-processing step to improve the classification of low-activity
#' period happening during a migration flight (e.g. gliding phase):
#' 1. Mid-activity surrounded by flights. The kmeans classification classify high-activity all
#' values above 50% of the distance between the two clusters. Here, we classify as mid-activity
#' non-flight activity data which value are greater than `thr_reclassify` of the distance between
#' the two kmeans clusters. Any periods of mid-activity surrounded by flight are also considered
#' as flights.
#' 2. To avoid stap lasting only a few datapoints, we also classify any datapoint
#' which is surrounded by a flight before and after, within a window of +/- `post_proc_window`
#' points. As a result, no stap will be shorter than `(2 * post_proc_window + 1) * dt`.
#'
#' This function is inspired by the function `classify_flap` from the
#' [PAMlr package](https://github.com/KiranLDA/PAMlr).

#' @inheritParams tag_label
#' @param min_duration Minimal duration (in minutes) to consider a high activity as migratory
#' flight.
#' @param thr_reclassify Post-processing threshold of activity considered for re-classification.
#' Typically between `0` and `0.5` (no effect). See post-processing for details.
#' @param post_proc_window Post-processing windows considered for re-classification. Typically `0`
#' (no effect) to `5` in unit of the temporal resolution. See post-processing for details.
#' @return Same data logger list than input `tag`, but with the column `label` filled with
#' `"flight"` in the acceleration data.frame when a sustained high-activity period is detected.
