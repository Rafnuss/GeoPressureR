#' Compute likelihood map from pressure data
#'
#' @description
#' The `geopressure_map()` function computes a likelihood map for each stationary period based on
#' pressure measurements. It is a wrapper of the following two child functions:
#'
#' 1. `geopressure_map_mismatch()` computes the mismatch maps between the pressure sensor
#' measurements and the ERA5 reanalysis database.
#' 2. `geopressure_map_likelihood()` converts the mismatch maps into a likelihood map.
#'
#' See below for details. For more background on the method behind these functions, please refer to
#' Nussbaumer et al. ([2023a](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14043)).
#'
#' @details
#'
#' A map will only be computed for the stationary periods included in `tag$stap$include` and without
#' a known position `tag$stap$known_l**` as defined by `tag_set_map()`. At known stationary
#' periods, the likelihood map is a map of `0`s with a single `1` at the pixel closest to the known
#' position.
#'

#' @section Mismatch map with GeoPressureAPI:
#'
#' `geopressure_map_mismatch()` computes the mismatch maps on Google Earth Engine via the map
#' entry point of the [GeoPressure API](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureAPI/#description).
#' This consists of the following steps:
#'
#' 1. **Pre-process pressure**: the pressure measurements are first smoothed and downscaled to a
#' 1-hour resolution in order to match ERA-5 resolution (see `geopressure_map_preprocess()`).
#' 2. **Generate requests**: Send a single request to the GeoPressureAPI to generate the Google
#' Earth Engine (GEE) URLs, one for each elevation/stationary period which can be used to compute
#' the maps on the GEE server.
#' 3. **Send the requests**: Call the URLs, which will start the computation on the GEE server.
#' At this step, it does not wait for an answer, but sends the requests in parallel to be faster.
#' 4. **Compute and download the maps**: When all requests are sent, we wait for the GEE server to
#' return a geotiff file (map) for each elevation/ stationary period.
#' 5. **Post-process maps**: Read these geotiff maps as matrix, create the corresponding
#' GeoPressureR `map` object with `create_map()`.
#'
#' The following two maps are returned for each stationary period:
#'
#' 1. **map_pressure_mse**: The Mean Square Error (MSE) between the data logger pressure time series
#' and the reanalysis. The mean error is removed because we assume no specific altitude of the
#' geolocator, thus allowing an altitudinal shift of the pressure time series.
#' 2. **map_pressure_mask** (optionally): The mask of the proportion of pressure measurements
#' corresponding to altitude values found within the min and max ground elevation at each location.
#' The altitude value of the geolocator pressure time series is computed with the barometric formula
#' accounting for the temporal variation of pressure (surface-pressure) and temperature
#' (2m-temperature) based on ERA5 data. The min and max ground elevation of each pixel is computed
#' from SRTM-90. This map is only returned if `keep_mask` is `TRUE`.
#'
#' For more details, read the [GeoPressure API documentation
#' ](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureAPI/).
#'
#' @section Elevation levels:
#'
#' It is possible to indicate different elevation levels when the bird was spending time at
#' locations with different elevations within a general area (~10km), and thus within the same
#' stationary period. This can be done by using `tag$label="elev_x"` for all measurements of the
#' same elevation level *x*. See more information on the labelling of elevation levels in [the
#' corresponding section in the GeoPressureManual](
#' https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureManual/labelling-tracks.html#elevation-period).
#'
#' Behind the scene, each of these elevation levels produces a new request on the GeoPressureAPI.
#' The mismatch maps of all elevation levels belonging to the same stationary periods are combined
#' (as a weighted average) to result in a single mismatch map per stationary period.
#'
#' @section Convert mismatch map into likelihood map:
#'
#' We convert the map of the mean square error \eqn{MSE} and altitude mask \eqn{z_{mask}} computed
#' by [`geopressure_map_mismatch()`] into a likelihood map with,
#'
#' \deqn{L = \left( \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma^2}\right)^{\frac{nw}{2}}
#' \exp \left(-w n \frac{MSE}{2\sigma^2} \right) \left[z_{mask}>T \right],}
#'
#' where \eqn{\sigma} is the standard deviation (`sd`) of pressure and \eqn{T} is the mask threshold
#' (`thr_mask`).
#'
#' Because the auto-correlation of the time series is not accounted for in this equation, we use a
#' log-linear pooling weight of \eqn{w=\log(n)/n} by default, where \eqn{n} is the number of samples
#' in the time series (i.e., data points used to compute the MSE). See [GeoPressureManual |
#' Probability aggregation
#' ](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureManual/probability-aggregation.html) for details.
#'
#' **Important Note**: Since GeoPressure v3.1.0, the threshold of the mask is happening directly
#' on the GEE server (i.e., during `geopressure_map_mismatch()`). This allows to compute the MSE
#' only for pixels which are within the threshold, thus reducing the computational cost
#' significantly.
#'
#' @param tag a GeoPressureR `tag` object
#' @param max_sample the computation of the maps is only performed on `max_sample` datapoints of
#' pressure to reduce computational time. The samples are randomly (uniformly) selected on the
#' time series.
#' @param margin the margin is used in the mask map to accept measurement errors, small-scale
#' topography, and vertical movements of the bird (unit in meters, 1hPa~10m).
#' @param sd standard deviation of the pressure error. Numeric of length 1 or number of stationary
#' periods.
#' @param thr_mask threshold of the percentage of data points outside the elevation range to be
#' considered not possible.
#' @param log_linear_pooling_weight weighting function of the log-linear pooling, taking the number
#' of samples of the stationary periods used and returning the weight of the aggregation. See
#' [GeoPressureManual | Probability aggregation
#' ](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureManual/probability-aggregation.html) for more details.
#' @param keep_mask logical defining if the mask map is returned in `tag`.
#' @param keep_mse logical defining if the MSE map is returned in `tag`.
#' @param timeout duration before the code is interrupted both for the request on
#' GeoPressureAPI and on GEE (in seconds, see `httr2::req_timeout()`).
#' @param workers number of parallel requests on GEE. Integer between 1 and 99. `"auto"` adjust the
#' number of workers to the number of `stapelev` to query.
#' @param compute_known logical defining if the map(s) for known stationary period should be
#' estimated based on twilight or hard defined by the known location `stap$known_l**`
#' @param quiet logical to hide messages about the progress
#' @param debug logical to display additional information to debug a request
#'
#' @return Returns the same GeoPressureR `tag` object including the GeoPressureR `map` object
#' `tag$map_pressure` containing the likelihood map of each stationary period. See `map_create()`
#' for details.
#' If `keep_mask` and `keep_mse` are each true, `tag` also includes the `tag$map_pressure_mse` and
#' `tag$map_pressure_mask` maps, as well as `tag$stap$nb_sample`, indicating the number of
#' datapoints used to compute the MSE.
