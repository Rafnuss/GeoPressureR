# GeoPressureR: Global positioning by atmospheric pressure.

GeoPressureR is a R package which help researchers determine the
position of a bird based on the data retrieved from multi-sensor
geolocators.

## Details

The main novelty of this package is to match atmospheric pressure
measurements to weather reanalysis database (ERA-5) and produce a
probability maps of position.

In addition, we use a graphical model to combine pressure, light,
acceleration and windspeed data into a trajectory model of the bird.
